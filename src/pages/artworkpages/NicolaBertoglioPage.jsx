It is a video performance in which I placed my animated virtual sculpture, titled “Dancing Goddess,” in various locations around my city, Milan, using augmented reality. I simply filmed my creation dancing in public spaces, in broad daylight. No thoughts, no worries — just a light and liberating dance. The sculpture was created from a photo of myself using the website Meshy.ai.          </p>
