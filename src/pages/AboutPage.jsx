          <p>
            In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, na√Øvet√©
            becomes both accusation and invitation. Too curious. Too slow. Too
            hopeful. Too easily convinced.
          </p>

          <p>
            As AI ascends, na√Øvet√©, presaging the unknown and the failures to
            know, is promised to be effaced in pursuit of perfection &amp;
            optimization. Uncertainty is to be predicted; ignorance, filled in at
            any cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            And yet, a thread of the na√Øve runs through every tale we tell,
            surfacing in the frictions underlying fleeting sensations:
            fascinations, fears, and eerie pauses of familiarity with the
            artificial. Never knowing enough, yet caught between fracturing
            visions of truth, we invite you to linger in this space of unknowing
            and discomfort, to look a bit closer at what it means to be ‚Äòtoo
            naive‚Äô in face of AI:
          </p>

          <p>
            Naivete, as an attitude, is then imagined as a gesture of refusal ‚Äì of
            not readily embracing what is told as such, or being too ready for it
            to the point of absurdity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tracing this blurry line within our entangled interactions, what are
            the hidden values and thresholds we must face as we navigate ways
            through which AI is now interwoven in our daily lives? Accompanying us
            through a playful, sometimes aloof wander, participating artists
            explore these tensions through experimentation with AI as medium,
            concept, and system. Tracing the contours of misunderstanding, belief,
            hesitation, and intimacy with curiosity, the works ask of us the
            values of looking otherwise, in failing to obey existing rules.

                  audiences to experience digital art in diverse formats and contexts. With

                  <strong>CodeSurfing (L∆∞·ªõt Code)</strong> is an art-tech collective
                  emerging from Ho Chi Minh City. Situated within the field of
                  digital humanities, the collective develops public programs,
                  curricular experiments, and collaborative research that connect
                  local communities with wider regional and international networks.
                  Its work promotes interdisciplinary inquiry across art, technology,
                  and the humanities and seeks to expand the boundaries and spaces of
                  artistic practice through the use of computational languages.

                  CodeSurfing‚Äôs projects have been presented at the Vietnam Women‚Äôs

                  were shortlisted as finalists for the Lumen Prize. The collective
                  is currently stewarded by Nhan Phan, Yui Nguyen, and Khoi Nguyen.

                  <strong>Nhi Phan</strong> is an art practitioner currently living
                  and working in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. She holds a Bachelor‚Äôs
                  degree in Social Studies with double minors in Art History and
                  History from Fulbright University Vietnam.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nhi‚Äôs practice lies at the intersection of contemporary art and
                  anthropological methods, with a particular interest in community-
                  based participatory approaches within the Vietnamese context.
                  Through curatorial and research practices, she explores questions
                  surrounding social interaction, forms of knowledge production, and
                  open-ended interdisciplinary dialogues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She has collaborated with S√†n Art and Heritage Art Space,
                  contributing to curatorial processes, community programming, and
                  translation publications. Her writings and translations have
